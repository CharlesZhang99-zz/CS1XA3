Elm-Game:
- My Elm game is my attempt to make the classic 80s arcade game "joust". It is NOT based off of any code found online.
- The goal of the game is to use A (left), D (right), Space (fly) keys to move the player and kill flying enemies.
- Enemies are killed when the player's jousting stick is above the center of the enemy. This also works if the player lands on top of the enemies
- Special thanks to Jatin for helping me with the HTML scaling issue
