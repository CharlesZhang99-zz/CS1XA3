### The program can do the following
- Partially evaluate an expression (or fully)
- Perform partial differentiation (symbolic)
- Perform some simplification of expressions
- Parse certain strings into an expression datatype

### I have done the following
- Provided thorough documentation on all my code
- Comment all my code thoroughly
- Divided into modules

### Citation
- For simplifications, I used  https://github.com/wengy12 code
- My ExprParser is largely inspired by https://github.com/chenc118 and  https://github.com/deleeuwj1
- My partDiff is inspired by https://github.com/chenc118
